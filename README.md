# Workers Sentinel

Workers Sentinel is a lightweight, self-hosted error tracking and monitoring solution that runs entirely on your Cloudflare account. It accepts events using the Sentry SDK wire format, allowing you to use existing Sentry SDKs by simply changing the DSN endpoint. All your error data is stored securely in SQLite-backed Durable Objects, giving you full control over your information.

- **✅ Issue Management**: Mark issues as resolved or ignored
- **🌐 Multi-Project**: Create multiple projects with isolated data storage

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Workers Sentinel, make sure you have:

- **Cloudflare Account** - [Sign up for free](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- **Node.js 20+** - For local development (not required for one-click deployment)

**Cloudflare Services Used:**
- Workers (Compute)
- Durable Objects with SQLite (State management)
- Workers Assets (Dashboard hosting)

All these services have generous free tiers sufficient for most use cases.

## Getting Started

### One-Click Deploy

Use the "Deploy to Cloudflare" button above, or run:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=https://github.com/G4brym/workers-sentinel/tree/main/template
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/G4brym/workers-sentinel.git
cd workers-sentinel

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build and deploy
pnpm deploy
```

### First-Time Setup

1. **Deploy your worker** to Cloudflare
2. **Visit your worker URL** in a browser
3. **Register the first user** - this becomes your admin account
4. **Create your first project** - you'll receive a DSN
5. **Configure your Sentry SDK** with the DSN

## SDK Configuration

Workers Sentinel is compatible with official Sentry SDKs. Simply use your Sentinel DSN instead of a Sentry DSN.

### JavaScript / Browser

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'https://<public_key>@<your-worker>.workers.dev/<project_id>',
});
```

### Node.js

```javascript
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'https://<public_key>@<your-worker>.workers.dev/<project_id>',
});
```

### Python

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://<public_key>@<your-worker>.workers.dev/<project_id>",
)
```

### Go

```go
import "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"

sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
    Dsn: "https://<public_key>@<your-worker>.workers.dev/<project_id>",
})
```

The DSN is displayed when you create a project in the dashboard, or you can find it in the project settings.

## Architecture

Workers Sentinel is built with modern web technologies:

**Backend (Worker):**
- **Hono** - Fast, lightweight web framework
- **Cloudflare Durable Objects** - Distributed state with SQLite storage
- **Sentry Envelope Parser** - Compatible with Sentry SDK wire format

**Frontend (Dashboard):**
- **Vue.js 3** - Progressive JavaScript framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Pinia** - State management
- **Vite** - Fast build tooling

**Data Architecture:**
- **AuthState DO** (singleton) - Users, sessions, project registry
- **ProjectState DO** (per-project) - Issues, events, statistics

Each project has its own isolated Durable Object with SQLite storage, ensuring data isolation and scalability.

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:

- [ ] Source map support for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Release tracking and deployment correlation
- [ ] Performance monitoring (transactions, spans)
- [ ] Alerting integrations (webhook, email)
- [ ] Session replay support
- [ ] Team/organization support
- [ ] Issue assignment
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Time-series charts
- [ ] Rate limiting per project
- [ ] Event retention policies

## Known Limitations

**Current Limitations:**
- No source map support yet (stack traces show minified code)
- No performance monitoring (error tracking only)
- No alerting/notifications
- Single-user admin (no team management yet)

**Sentry Feature Parity:**
Workers Sentinel focuses on core error tracking. Advanced Sentry features like:
- Session replay
- Performance monitoring
- Profiling
- Crons monitoring

Are not currently supported but may be added in future versions.

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Modern browsers required (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- JavaScript must be enabled
- Cookies must be enabled for authentication
